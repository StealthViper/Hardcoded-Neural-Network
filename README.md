# Hardcoded-Neural-Networks
A custom execution of the various types of neural networks hard coded in Python to understand its elemental functioning 

Basic implementation of the underlying dynamics of the elementary Neural Networks to better interpret their working.

**Activation function used** : Sigmoid 

**Accuracy on test set** = 97.18%

## CNN
Trained on the MNIST dataset for recognizing handwritten digits.

**Activation function used** : SoftMax

**Accuracy on test set** = 98.13%

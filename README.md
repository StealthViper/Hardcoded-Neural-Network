# Hardcoded-Neural-Networks
A custom execution of the various types of neural networks hardcoded in Python to understand their elemental functioning 

Basic implementation of the underlying dynamics of the elementary Neural Networks to better interpret their working.  

## ANN

**Activation function used** : Sigmoid 

**Accuracy on test set** = 97.18%

## CNN
Trained on the MNIST dataset for recognizing handwritten digits.

**Activation function used** : SoftMax

**Accuracy on test set** = 93.8%
